## Write a program that will prompt the user to enter an integer number between 1 and 12. 
## Your program should take the input given by the user and display which month the number corresponds to. 
## Additionally, you should also display how many days are typically in that month. 
## For example, if the user inputs ‘2’, your program should display: “The month (2) selected is February, it has 28 days.”. 
## If the user does not enter a number between 1 and 12, your program should display “Please enter a number between 1 and 12”.
